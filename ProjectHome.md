PyScripter is a **free** and **open-source** Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created with the ambition to become competitive in functionality with commercial Windows-based IDEs available for other languages. Being built in a compiled language is rather snappier than some of the other Python IDEs and provides an extensive blend of features that make it a productive Python development environment.

**Support:**
Get support on PyScripter by emailing to [pyscripter@gmail.com](mailto:pyscripter@gmail.com) or by visiting the [PyScripter Internet group](http://groups.google.com/group/PyScripter) and posting your questions and comments.

PyScripter comes in two flavors, 32-bit and 64-bit.  The 64-bit version will only work in a 64-bit version of Windows.  The 32-bit version of PyScripter requires the presence of a 32-bit python installation and the 64-bit version requires the presence of a 64-bit python installation from python.org.

**Notes:**
  * For compatibility with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, since version 1.9.9.5, PyScripter requires the [latest C++ Redistributable Package](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en). This is automatically installed by Python 2.6 and Python 3.x. If you do not have any of these versions installed, then you need to download and install it manually.
